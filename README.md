# Bubble-Sort
This project aims to create an algorithm in the LC3 assembly language that takes 8 numbers ranged 0-100 and sorts them from least to greatest. The program should accomplish this by comparing two adjacent numbers, checking if they are in order, and if they are not, swapping them. The program will continue to do this until all of the numbers are in order.
